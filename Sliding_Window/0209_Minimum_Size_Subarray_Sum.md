# 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum

## Intuition

The problem is to find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to the given target. This can be effectively solved using the **Sliding Window** approach, as the window dynamically adjusts to ensure the sum condition is met while minimizing the subarray length.

---

## Approach

1. Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the sliding window.
2. Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer to include elements in the current sum.
3. When the `current_sum` exceeds or equals the `target`, calculate the length of the current subarray (`right - left + 1`) and update the `min_length`.
4. Shrink the window from the left by moving the `left` pointer forward and subtracting `nums[left]` from `current_sum` until the sum is less than the `target`.
5. Repeat until the `right` pointer traverses the entire array.
6. If no valid subarray is found (`min_length == INT_MAX`), return 0.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: $$O(n)$$  
  - Both pointers traverse the array at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: $$O(1)$$
  - No additional space is used other than variables.
