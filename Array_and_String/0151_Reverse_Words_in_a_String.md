## Intuition
The goal of this problem is to reverse the words in a given string while ensuring that extra spaces between the words are handled properly, and leading or trailing spaces are removed.

---
## Approach
1. **Split the String**: We can use an `istringstream` to break the input string into words. This allows us to ignore extra spaces, as it automatically skips over multiple spaces between words.
2. **Reverse the Words**: After splitting the string into words, store the words in a vector. We can then reverse the order of the words in the vector using `std::reverse`.
3. **Join the Words**: Once the words are reversed, iterate through the vector and join them into a single string, adding a space between words but avoiding leading or trailing spaces.
---
## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: $$O(n)$$
$$n$$ is the length of the input string. This is because we go through the string once to split it into words and then reverse the vector.
- **Space Complexity**: $$O(n)$$
Store the words in a vector which requires additional space proportional to the number of characters in the string.

/*************************************************
* Name:        reverseWords
* 
* Description: Reverses the order of words in a given string
*              while removing extra spaces between words.
* 
* Arguments:   - std::string s: Input string with words separated
*                                by spaces.
* 
* Returns:     - std::string: A string with words in reversed order,
*                             and each word separated by a single space.
