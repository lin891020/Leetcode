# 35. 3Sum

## **Intuition**

The problem requires finding unique triplets in an array that sum to zero. The core idea is:

1. **Sort the array**: Sorting allows efficient use of the two-pointer technique.
2. **Fix one number**: Use one pointer to fix an element, and solve for the remaining two numbers using two pointers.
3. **Two-pointer technique**: With a sorted array, the two-pointer approach enables efficiently finding pairs that sum to the negative of the fixed number.

## **Approach**

1. **Sort the array**:
   - Sorting helps skip duplicates and facilitates two-pointer traversal.
2. **Outer loop**: Iterate through the array, fixing one element (`nums[i]`).
   - Skip duplicate elements to avoid duplicate triplets.
3. **Inner two-pointer loop**:
   - Initialize two pointers: `left` (just after the fixed element) and `right` (at the array's end).
   - Compute the sum of the fixed element and the two pointer values:
     - If the sum is less than 0, increment the `left` pointer.
     - If the sum is greater than 0, decrement the `right` pointer.
     - If the sum is zero, store the triplet and move both pointers, skipping duplicates.
4. **Return the result list** containing all unique triplets.

## **Complexity**

- **Time Complexity**: $$O(n^2)$$
  - Sorting the array takes $$O(n log n)$$.
  - The two-pointer loop for each fixed element runs in $$O(n)$$, and there are `n` such elements.
- **Space Complexity**: $$O(k)$$
For storing the results, where `k` is the number of unique triplets.

                    result.push_back({nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]});

                    while (left < right && nums[right] == nums[right - 1]) right--;
                    left++;
                    right--;
                }

        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

### **Question 1: Why does the inner `while` need to check `left < right`?**

#### **Problem Background**

- The outer `while (left < right)` already checks the relative position of `left` and `right`.
- The inner `while` is used to skip duplicate values, such as:
  ```cpp
  while (left < right && nums[left] == nums[left + 1]) left++;
  while (left < right && nums[right] == nums[right - 1]) right--;
  ```

### Answer: To Prevent Pointer Overflow

When the inner while loop skips duplicate values, the pointers (`left` and `right`) may keep moving, which could lead to:

1. left exceeding right (or both becoming equal):
If the pointers cross, subsequent operations could result in index out-of-bounds errors.
2. Infinite loop:
Conditions like `nums[left] == nums[left + 1]` or `nums[right] == nums[right - 1]` could continuously evaluate to `true` without `left < right`, causing an infinite loop.

#### Specific Example

Given the input:
```
nums = [-2, 0, 0, 0, 2]
```
The goal is to find all triplets that sum to `0`.

- Initial Pointers:
    - `i = 0`, `nums[i] = -2`
    - `left = 1`, `nums[left] = 0`
    - `right = 4`, `nums[right] = 2`
- Found a Valid Triplet:

```
nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right] == 0
Triplet: [-2, 0, 2]
```

- Skipping Duplicate Values: Move the `left` pointer to skip all the `0`s:

```
while (left < right && nums[left] == nums[left + 1]) left++;
```

- `left` increments to `2`, `3`, and finally `4`.
- When `left == right`:`If left < right`  is not checked in the inner `while`, it would continue to execute, potentially causing invalid operations or infinite loops.
